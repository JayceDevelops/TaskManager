# Practice Web Application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript & MySQL)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **practice web application** built to strengthen foundational and intermediate web development skills. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** on the front end, with **MySQL** serving as the database on the back end.

⚠️ **Important Note:**  
This application is **not intended to be internet-accessible or deployed publicly**. It is designed strictly for **local development and learning purposes**. Security, scalability, and production deployment considerations are outside the scope of this project.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure and semantic markup  
- **CSS** – Styling, layout, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript** – Client-side logic and interactivity  
- **MySQL** – Relational database for data storage  
- *(Optional / assumed)* Server-side environment (e.g., Node.js, PHP, or similar)

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience by building a complete, end-to-end web application. Rather than focusing on polish or production readiness, the emphasis is on **learning by doing**, experimentation, and reinforcing core concepts.
